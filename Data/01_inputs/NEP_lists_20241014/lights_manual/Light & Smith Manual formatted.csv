The body consists of upper and lower epithelia, both flagellated but lacking a basal lamina; they enclose between them a fluid-filled space containing a network of contractile cells. There are none of the specialized cells, tissues, or organ systems typical of most animals (digestive, circulatory, excretory, neurosensory, or muscular), and there is no fixed symmetry. Despite this extreme morphological simplicity, placozoans are capable of simple behaviors, such as withdrawal and reversal of direction if poked with a needle on one edge, or righting if dislodged from the substrate and overturned. However, they are not easily dislodged: the specific name Trichoplax adhaerens von Schultze, 1883 reflects their ability to stick to a surface.""",0.48784127,"Carlton, J. T. (Ed.). (2007).
