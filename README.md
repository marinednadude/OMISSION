Organismal Mapping for Identification of Source Sequence Information Omissions in Nucleotide databases

This project aims to develop and implement the Organismal Mapping for Identification of Source Sequence Information Omissions in Nucleotide databases (OMISSION) tool kit to conduct quality control and assurance on taxonomic names, cross reference identifications with both World Register of Marine Species (WORMS) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nomenclature, pull relevant sequence and metadata records from NCBI repositories, and cross referenced this species list against rCRUX generated reference databases for a suite of commonly used barcoding loci (COI, 12S, 16S, 28S, 18S, cytB) (Figure 1).
